# FinTrust Customer Portal

A production-style cloud application demonstrating the deployment of a containerized Flask web application on AWS using **Terraform**, **Docker**, **Amazon ECR**, **Application Load Balancer**, **Auto Scaling**, and **Amazon RDS**.

This project was built as part of my **80 AWS Projects Roadmap** to gain hands-on experience designing, provisioning, deploying, and troubleshooting production-ready cloud infrastructure.

---

# Project Overview

FinTrust Customer Portal is a simple customer management application that allows users to:

- Add customers
- View customer records
- Edit customer information
- Delete customers

The application is built with Flask and SQLAlchemy, containerized using Docker, and deployed automatically to EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer.

- Security Groups
- IAM Roles
- Amazon RDS
- Application Load Balancer
- Launch Template
- Auto Scaling Group

Deployment

```bash
terraform init

terraform plan

terraform apply
```

---

# Running the Application Locally

Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate

Windows

```bash
source .venv/Scripts/activate
```

Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run

```bash
python run.py
```

---

# Docker

Build image

```bash
docker build -t fintrust-customer-portal .
```

Run

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 \
--env-file .env \
fintrust-customer-portal
```

---

# Amazon ECR

Build

```bash
docker build -t fintrust-customer-portal .
```

Tag

```bash
docker tag fintrust-customer-portal:latest \
<account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/fintrust-customer-portal:latest
```

Push

```bash
docker push \

```

---

# Health Check

Endpoint

```
GET /health
```

Response

```json
{
    "status": "healthy"
}
```

Used by the Application Load Balancer to verify instance health.
